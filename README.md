# Audio-Steganography

Hides a 280 character message inside the audio by encoding the character into its frequencies.

Since the encoding occurs outside the human hearing range, the encoded message is undetectable when played through the air and it can be received through a microphone to be decoded back into its plaintext.

Requires the "enable audio enhancements" check box in the microphone setting to be unticked
